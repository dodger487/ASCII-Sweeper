ASCII-Sweeper
=============

An ASCII-based minesweeper, written in jQuery.

I wrote this as a way to get familiar with jQuery. It's pretty hacky and 
not totally clean. However, there are comments and it works just fine. 
If I were to redo it, I'd do a better job of using javascript objects, 
not referencing a bunch of variables outside of functions, etc. However, 
the main goal of the project was to have some fun with jQuery. Goal 
acheived!

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via github.
